## Introduction ##
In 2018 my team BRACU Duburi attended SAUVC2018. That was the first time any team from Bangladesh attended any international underwater competition. While it was a good news for my university, it was not that good for us. Because nobody have ever worked on AUV or ROV before, so we could not get any swimming pool that allowed us to test our AUV. Everyone was afraid that AUVs might spill oil. 

So, I decides to make a simulator to try the computer vision in it. I am not a game developer still as this was our only option, I learned a little about game development in Unity and made this simulator. If you are an experienced game developer you might find a lot of mistakes, please pardon me. I had to get things done :D

### What is inside? ###
It's an underwater simulator based on the final round of SAUVC. There is a gate of green and red and 4 bowls over a green mat. I haven't added the flare as my team was not ready for that on 2018. 

### Movements ###
1. Movements -> W,A,S,D
2. Turns -> Right, Left arrow
3. Up and Down -> Up and Down Arrow.
4. Change Camera - C

### How to Use it? ###
1. Install Unity (Free version would work)
2. Run the file __ROV Simulator.exe__

### How to Contribute ###
Everything is in this folder. If you know game development in Unity you can easily tweak things.

__Note*__ - I might have changed some movement settings. So, running the file from Unity might not be same as the exe file. Here is the Zip File to download the version that is exactly as the .exe file - [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qxT1IPpUchh3P8NON_IHZIA1a_ToGLKu/view?usp=sharing) 

### Why am I sharing this? ###
Leading a team to something totally new in our country was really a challenge because of not having access to underwater components and the testing facilities. As a first timer we faced a lot of challenges. We were building an AUV but we could not get a swimming pool to test it. I don't think, there can be something more horrible than this. So, I made this simulator to try the computer vision part and a small tank to test out AUV's balance and depth hold.  
I though it was only our problem. But then after attending SAUVC2018, I found it was a common problem for a lot of teams.
Thus I decided to share this simulator so that teams who do not have access to swimming pools or it's not even possible to try computer vision in swimming pool all the time can use this simulator. 


### My expectations ###
I believe more people will contribute to this project and make this a perfect simulator for SAUVC.
I have completed my graduation and I cannot attending SAUVC anymore. This is a gift from me for the teams attending SAUVC.
